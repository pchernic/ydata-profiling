# ðŸ“Š Ydata-profiling for EDA
This code explores ydata-profiling to automate and accelerate exploratory data analysis (EDA). With just a few lines of code, you can generate a comprehensive report that highlights:

Data types and distributions

Missing values and duplicates

Correlations and interactions

Warnings and data quality issues

Visual summaries and insights

We're using the Telco Customer Churn dataset to demonstrate how ydata-profiling can uncover patterns and potential drivers of customer churnâ€”without writing a single chart manually.

Built and tested in Google Colab, this repo is ideal for data scientists, analysts, and learners who want to supercharge their EDA workflow.
